## Reason
I wanted to play with a Raspberry Pi, to learn to use k8s, and to have an easy way to back up files when I'm home. 
Also, my wife's phone was running out of free space, so it had to behave similar to an icloud or a dropbox app. 
After a quick search I have found that there are multiple apps for that. 
The [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com) seemed to match my goals. 
It also had a docker image, and it's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/nextcloud) was updated frequently.
The last thing I wanted was an app that is not supported.
