Hi everyone! 

My name is Sasha Bondarev. I am from Odessa, Ukraine. Right now I am a senior SDET in Vonage.

I love to learn new skills and new things. Sometimes there is no single source for what I am trying to learn.
In those cases I need to search in multiple places. Occasionally, I am sharing what I have learned.
Right now I am trying to utilize GitHub Pages for this purpose.
